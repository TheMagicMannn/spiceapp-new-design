## 2. Open Graph Image Strategy ✅

### Implementation Approach:
Since we cannot create custom branded images in the current environment, we've implemented a strategic OG image solution:

#### **Smart Image Selection:**
- Each page uses a carefully selected, high-quality Unsplash image (1200x630px) that matches the page content
- Images are professional, relevant, and visually appealing for social sharing
- OG images are different for each page to provide visual variety when shared

#### **Current OG Images by Page:**

| Page | OG Image Theme | URL |
|------|---------------|-----|
| Homepage | Community/connection | Already configured |
| Quiz | BDSM/exploration | Already configured |
| Download | App/mobile | Already configured |
| HowTo | Relationships/communication | `photo-1586380951230-e6703d9f6833` |
| Community | People/groups | `photo-1522202176988-66273c2fd55f` |
| Glossary | Education/books | `photo-1457369804613-52c61a468e7d` |
| Safety | Security/protection | `photo-1555421689-d68471e189f2` |
| Self-Care | Wellness/health | `photo-1506126613408-eca07ce68773` |
| Articles | Dynamic per article | Uses article.image field |

#### **Future Recommendation:**
Create custom branded OG images with:
- SPICE branding/logo
- Page-specific tagline
- Consistent color scheme (matching SPICE brand)
- Professional design optimized for 1200x630px
- Upload to `/app/frontend/public/og-images/` directory
