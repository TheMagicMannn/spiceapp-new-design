                    My wife Sarah and I had been together for eight years when we first started talking about hotwifing. What began as pillow talk fantasy slowly evolved into serious conversations over about six months. We read everything we could, had countless late-night discussions, and worked through our <Link to="/blog/hotwifing-jealousy" className="text-primary hover:underline">jealousy concerns</Link> before deciding we were ready to try.

                      We agreed Sarah would text "when she could," which left me in anxious limbo. There was a 45-minute gap where I heard nothing and my mind went to dark places.

                    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground italic">
