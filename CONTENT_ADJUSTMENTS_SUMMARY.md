---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **TrustBadgesSection Component**

#### Badge Updates
**BEFORE:** "LGBTQ+ Inclusive" - "Welcoming community for all identities" (40% LGBTQ+ Members)
**AFTER:** "Lifestyle Community" - "Swingers, ENM, poly, BDSM & kink enthusiasts" (5,000+ Active Couples)

**Reason:** Shifted focus from identity-based messaging to lifestyle focus, emphasizing the actual activities and interests (swingers, ENM, poly, BDSM, kink).

#### Section Headers
**BEFORE:** "A Community That Celebrates Diversity"
**AFTER:** "Where the Lifestyle Comes Alive"

**BEFORE:** "Join thousands of verified couples and singles exploring connections in a safe, inclusive, and sex-positive environment"
**AFTER:** "Join thousands of verified couples and singles exploring swingers, ENM, polyamory, BDSM, and kink connections in a safe, judgment-free environment"

#### Testimonial
**BEFORE:** "As a queer polyamorous couple, we finally found a space where we truly belong." - Alex & Jordan
**AFTER:** "The verification gives us peace of mind, and we've met amazing like-minded couples who share our interests in swinging and ENM." - Mike & Sarah, Swinging Couple

**Reason:** Testimonial now focuses on lifestyle activities (swinging, ENM) rather than identity aspects.

### 2. **Community Images**

#### Image Replacements
**OLD IMAGES (Diversity-focused):**
- Diverse group on campus
- People holding hands on tree
- Community circle gathering

**NEW IMAGES (Lifestyle-focused):**

   - Alt: "Intimate sensual connection - sophisticated lifestyle dating on SPICE"
   - Artistic sand sculpture representing intimate embrace

   - Atmospheric party scene representing lifestyle events

**Reason:** Images now represent the sensual, intimate, lifestyle-focused nature of the app rather than general diversity imagery.

### 3. **FAQ Page Updates**

#### Question Change
**BEFORE:** "Is SPICE LGBTQ+ friendly?"
Answer focused heavily on LGBTQ+ inclusivity and celebration of diversity.

**AFTER:** "Who can use SPICE?"
Answer: "SPICE is for adventurous couples and singles of all genders and sexualities interested in exploring swingers, ENM, polyamory, BDSM, and kink lifestyles. Whether you're experienced in the lifestyle or just curious, our platform welcomes anyone seeking authentic connections in the alternative relationship space."

**Reason:** Natural mention of inclusivity ("all genders and sexualities") without making it the primary focus. Emphasis on lifestyle activities.

#### Meta Description
**BEFORE:** "...LGBTQ+ inclusivity, pricing..."
**AFTER:** "...pricing, and how to get started with lifestyle dating for adventurous couples and singles."

#### Keywords
**REMOVED:** "LGBTQ+ dating questions"
**ADDED:** "swinging couples questions"

---

### 4. **Landing Page (Index.tsx)**

#### Meta Description
**BEFORE:** "LGBTQ+ inclusive community for adventurous couples and singles"
**AFTER:** "Judgment-free lifestyle community for adventurous couples and singles of all genders"

**Reason:** Maintains inclusivity with "all genders" but emphasizes "judgment-free lifestyle" as the core value proposition.

#### Keywords
**REMOVED:** "LGBTQ+ dating"
**ADDED:** "threesome dating"

**Reason:** More aligned with swinging/lifestyle activities rather than identity-based dating.

---

### 5. **Hero Sections (Both HeroSection.tsx and EnhancedHeroSection.tsx)**

#### Tagline Update
**BEFORE:** "...in a safe, LGBTQ+ inclusive lifestyle community"
**AFTER:** "...in a safe, judgment-free lifestyle community"

**BEFORE:** "...exploring swingers, BDSM, and ENM connections"
**AFTER:** "...exploring swingers, BDSM, ENM, polyamory, and kink connections"

**Reason:** Added polyamory and kink to be more comprehensive. Replaced "LGBTQ+ inclusive" with "judgment-free" which is more universally applicable to the lifestyle.
