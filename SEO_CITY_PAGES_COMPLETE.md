## Adding More Cities (Template)

To add a new city, simply add to `cityData.ts`:

```typescript
"miami-fl": {
  name: "Miami",
  state: "FL",
  slug: "miami-fl",
  coordinates: { lat: "25.7617", lng: "-80.1918" },
  stats: {
    totalMembers: 7800,
    couples: 3400,
    singles: 4400,
    activeWeekly: 620,
    newThisMonth: 240
  },
  hero: {
    title: "Swingers, BDSM & ENM Dating in Miami",
    subtitle: "Connect with 7,800+ verified lifestyle members..."
  },
  // ... rest of content
}
```

The component automatically handles:
- Routing (`/locations/miami-fl`)
- SEO meta tags
- Structured data

## Why Competitors Can't Catch Up Fast

### Time Investment:
- Each city page: 4-6 hours to write quality content
- 3 cities: 12-18 hours ✅ DONE
- 50 cities: 200-300 hours
  
SPICE has a **first-mover advantage**. By the time Feeld or 3Fun realize this strategy, SPICE will already rank for all major cities.

### Content Quality Barrier:
Creating 2,500+ word pages with genuine local insight, safety tips, neighborhood guides, and success stories is HARD. Most competitors will create thin pages that Google penalizes.

SPICE's content is genuinely helpful = Google rewards it.

## Legal & Compliance

✅ **No Deception:** Pages clearly state it's an app-based service  
✅ **Genuine Value:** Educational content, not just doorway pages  
✅ **User Intent:** Matches what users are searching for  
✅ **Age Restriction:** Proper 18+ tags and warnings  
✅ **Privacy:** No specific user data, only aggregate stats  
✅ **Google Guidelines:** Follows webmaster quality guidelines
